### Yet Another Attempt to Describe Monads
This section is still in draft form.  I'll be moving into D3 interactives this Winter, and will be adding many code samples here.  Stay tuned.



- Like the terms 'Object' and 'Class', the term 'Monad' has a bunch of different meanings.  Don't get overly bogged down with the technical definitions.  Just remember that Monad's are computation objects or method chains.  

- Most tutorials you'll see written on Monads are written in purely functional programming languages, like Lisp, Scheme, or Haskell.  The syntax is considerably different between them and Javascript, so you'll need to imagine lots and lots of parenthesis and braces added to all of the Lispy tutorials you run across.

- If you use a Mac, there's a UI application for programming Monads called Automator.  It's possibly the most single powerful application in the entire OSX operating system.

- For most uses in Meteor, you won't be concerned with the Maybe pattern, so much as the Writer and I/O forms.  

- Monads generate most of their magic through side-effects.  

- Monads and Objects are inverses of each other.  There's a Yin/Yang thing going on.

- Monads are focused on the function, the becoming, the doing, the verb.  Objects are focused on the state, the presence, the noun.

- Any Object can be described as a Monad; any Monad can be described as a Object.  They are formally translatable to each other.  But they're based on very different worldviews and perspectives.  

- There's a front-loading version of Monad and method-chains, that often uses a selector of some type (jQuery, D3, others).

- And there's a back-loading version.  The back-loading versions are the hardest to learn.  It's very much like learning to read Reverse Polish Notation (RPN) or German, where the verbs are at the very end of the sentence.  Only, with method-chains, it's the data input that's at the very end of the chain.  
&#5783;&#5761;&#5766;&#5761;&#5761;&#5760;&#5760;&#5760;&#5782;


- Also, Monads have a very Alice-In-Wonderland habit of referencing things that don't exist with their selectors, then instantiating those very things as side effects of the computation on the data that's passed into them.  It's completely contrary to what you'd expect.  Sort of like levitating or literally lifting one's self off the ground.   

- I tend to think of Monads in terms of 4D tunnels.  Sort of like Donnie Darko.  Weird analogy, I know.  But surprisingly useful.

- The best book I've ever ran across that dealt with Monads was actually Neal Stephenson's The Baroque Cycle.  It's like 3,000 pages of Newton vs Leibniz, but has great characters like Eliza and Daniel and Jack.  Oddly enough, it really helps to understand the historical context between Newton's and Leibniz's calculus, because most of the Church/Turing Lambda Calculus is based off of Leibniz's conceptions of Monads.  Be warned....  The Baroque Cycle is written as a mobius strip, so you may likely need to read it twice to understand the entire plot.  

- Once you read Baroque Cycle, Leibniz, Church/Turing, Donnie Darko, etc....  this following statement will make a bit more sense:  Monads are sort of about computational surface area.  One might go so far as to say quantized computational surface area.  

- And going from that, you might say that they're... sort of like a derivative or integral of an Object.  They live on the circumference of objects.  On the surface area of objects.  They're like arteries and capillaries that objects move through.  

- It took me a few years to get a handle on method chaining and monads.  So, be aware that this is one of those topics that you may need to meditate on!
