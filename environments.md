## Development Environment

**Q:  What are best practices for setting up my development environment?**  
Well, you're going to need to select an Integrated Development Environment (IDE), configure it so it works with Meteor, and set up debugging and profiling utilities.  See below.  

**Q:  Which editor should I use with Meteor?**  
Well, you're going to need to chose an IDE and editor to work with, the most popular of which seems to be Webstorm, since it's got the best refactoring tools.  
http://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/  

Some people are also reporting success with Coda.

**Q:  Any recommendations on Chrome or Firefox Extensions?**  

Window Resizer (Chrome)

Firebug (Firefox)

**Q:  Any recommendations on pair-programming?**

Nitrous.io  
https://www.nitrous.io/  

Run the following command in the Nitrous.io (web) command line to create a Meteor project.  
````
parts install meteor
````



**Q:  My editor keeps crashing!  Help!**  
Add the myapp/.meteor directory to your ignore list.  Meteor takes your application and goes through a process called bundling, where it prepares to host it as a node.js application.  It uses the .meteor directory as a temp directory, and will try to rebundle whenever there are changes to your code.  If your editor is watching that directory, it can cause your editor to lock up with the constant indexing and bundling. 

````js
// Webstore > Preferences > Directories > Excluded Directories
.meteor
````

**Q:  How do I debug node.js itself?**  
````
npm install -g node-inspector

export NODE_OPTIONS='--debug'
sudo mrt run
sudo node-inspector &

http://0.0.0.0:8080/debug?port=5858
````


**Q:  Help!  I'm behind a proxy!  How can I install/run Meteor behind a reverse proxy?**  
This is a networking issue related to your operating system and local network topology, something that the Meteor Development Group doesn't really have any control over.  Some people have had success updating their bash environment variables, and running the installer with curl, like so:
````js
// make sure your shell knows about your proxy
export http_proxy=http://your.proxy.server:port/

// install meteor manually
curl https://install.meteor.com | sh
````

## PRODUCTION ENVIRONMENT

**Q:  Help!  Something broke in production!**  
Did you check it with ``--debug``?  There is a minification library that will parse your CSS and Javascript.  Check that it hasn't mangled your application by running your app with --debug.

**Q:  How do I deploy to Heroku?**  
Sadly, just don't.  Prior to 0.6.0, lots of people were using the Oortcloud Heroku Buildpack with much success.  As of 0.6.0, it seems to have broken, however.  And it's a moot point, because Heroku doesn't support Sticky Sessions, and won't scale up or support fail-over configurations.  Instead, use Meteor.com, CloudBees, or Modulus.io.

**Q:  Are there any cloud hosting providers that provide unit testing?**  
CloudBees provides a Meteor clickstart, software-as-a-service, unit testing, and continuous integration.  It's a bit klunky, but if you're worried about continuous integration, it's the one to choose:  
https://github.com/CloudBees-community/meteor-clickstart  

**Q:  How do I specify an external database using MONGO_URL?**  
Okay, so you're starting to talk about separating your application layer from your database layer, and getting things ready for scale-out.  If you're looking for something quick and simple, try Modulus.io:  
http://blog.modulus.io/demeteorizer  
https://github.com/onmodulus/demeteorizer  

````
sudo npm install -g demeteorizer
sudo cd ~/path/myapp

sudo demeteorizer -n 0.8.11
sudo cd .demeteorized
sudo modulus login
sudo modulus deploy
````

**Q:  What environment variables are supported?**  
So far, the following variables have been seen in the wild:  

PORT  
MONGO_URL  
ROOT_URL  
OPLOG_URL  
METEOR_SETTINGS  
NODE_OPTIONS  
DISABLE_WEBSOCKETS  
MAIL_URL  
DDP_DEFAULT_CONNECTION_URL  
HTTP_PROXY  
HTTPS_PROXY  


------------------------------------------------------------------
**Q:  Is there any documentation on the Meteor.settings?**    
So far, the following setting parameters have been seen in the wild:  

````
Meteor.settings.privateKey == "MY_KEY"  
Meteor.settings.public.publicKey == "MY_PUBLIC_KEY"   
Meteor.settings.public.anotherPublicKey == "MORE_KEY"  
````


**Q:  What's the best practice for using content distribution networks (CDN)?**  
Currently, there's not anything specific, other than putting static content on your CDN, and creating links to it from your app.  You may want to run the meteor bundle command, and take a peek in the resulting tar.gz file.
````
meteor bundle
````
