Hi.  Welcome to my Meteor Cookbook, FAQ, and Tutorial, culled from about 6 months of emails and discussions from the [meteor] google group and my experiences rolling out packages and apps.  These documents are intended for the intermediate user who is accustomed to a) object-oriented frameworks and languages, such as Java and C#, and b) relational databases and data structures derived from SQL table schemas.
