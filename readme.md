Hi.  Welcome to my Meteor Cookbook, FAQ, and Tutorial, culled from about 9 months of emails and discussions from the [meteor] google group and my experiences rolling out packages and apps.  These documents are intended for the intermediate user who is accustomed to a) object-oriented frameworks and languages, such as Java and C#, and b) relational databases and data structures derived from SQL table schemas.

- Links from private gmail account removed.
- The Cookbook is growing!  It was actually getting so cumbersome to edit, that I split it into a dozen files.  So, we now have an index!
