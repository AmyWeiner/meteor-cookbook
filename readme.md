Hi.  Welcome to my Meteor Cookbook, FAQ, and Tutorial, culled from about 6 months of emails and discussions from the [meteor] google group and my experiences rolling out packages and apps.  These documents are intended for the intermediate user who is accustomed to a) object-oriented frameworks and languages, such as Java and C#, and b) relational databases and data structures derived from SQL table schemas.

## Meteor Licensing and Branding

**Q:  Is there a Meteor logo?**  
Currently, there is no Meteor logo, but Cloudbees has been using a modified Nodejs logo, which works very nicely too:

**Q:  I heard Meteor is licensed under the GPL.  Will it be available under the MIT license?**  
Meteor is now available under the MIT license.  They switched licenses around version 0.4.0.
