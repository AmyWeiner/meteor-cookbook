Generally speaking, animations are part of the View and the Presentation Layer, since they're implemented using CSS.  Using Javascript to implement animations is not recommended, and will lead to flicker.  Use CSS3 transforms so you can run things on the GPU.  But be careful!  Be sure to audit your CSS files!
