 
### Document Model Templates
**Q:  I want to use Jade/Blade/Dust as my templating engine.  Are they supported?**  
Why would you want to do this?  The Spark templates have had a lot of work put into them, and can basically do everything that Jade, Blade, and Dust can do, but better.  That being said, if you're hell-bent on replacing the default templating engine, a few people have reporting some success getting jade and blade working, and there are packages in Atmosphere, but nobody seems to have gotten dust working yet.  Of the three, Jade seems to have the best documentation and integration so far.  But seriously... ask yourself why you would ever actually want to do this.  Don't you have better things to do with your time?
