### Refactoring

**Q:  How do I choose what way to run a function?**  

1. Include {{foo}} in the "bar" template and then set up Template.bar.foo {...}.
2. Include {{foo}} in the "bar" template and set up Template.bar.helpers including "foo" {...}.
3. Include a Meteor.method of "foo" {...} on the client.

I always use # 1 by default.  When I find myself repeating a chunk of code repeatedly, I refactor and extract the duplicate code into a helper function, as per #2.  I only use #3 in the rare cases when I need the server to trigger something on the client (ie.  almost never; it's usually the other way around; methods on the server, not client).   $0.02
