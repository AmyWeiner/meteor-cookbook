Hello, and welcome to the Automat (nee, the Meteor Cookbook).

In writing this Cookbook, I've learned a whole lot about about Javascript, Functional Programming, Application Design, and a host of other topics, which has caused me to adopt some particular views about Meteor and best practices.  

#### The OSI Model  

So, at one point in time, I was working an admin for a Radiology Department, which is all based on the DICOM protocol, which itself is based on the OSI 7 layer model.  This model is typically used to model network communications.  But here's a nifty little bit of trivia for you:  the OSI model can also be used to describe video transmission.  Instead of Ethernet and network cables, the Physical and Data Link layers are video screens and pixels.  Instead of data packets, one can talk about JPG and PNG images (which are just pixel based data packets).  So, be forewarned:  the Meteor Cookbook adopts what may be some peculilar usage of the OSI model to describe client side haptics, device drivers, and the like.  Where most people think of JPG and PNG images as Presentation Layer or Application Layer functionality, I'll sometimes refer to them as Data Link layer.  Same thing goes with Mouse controls and Drag-and-Drop functionality, for exmaple.  Most people don't consider Mice to have anything to do with Networking, and consider them to be Application Layer functionality.  But if you think in terms of wireless and line-of-sight communications, then the boundary of what's a 'network device' becomes a bit blurry.  And I tend to use that blurriness to describe Human-Computer Interactions.  So, I'll sometimes refer to Mice and Device Drivers as being part of the Physical and Data Link layers.  Run with it.  It works.

[more to come...  writing this stuff takes time...  :p]
